# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses TypeScript type consistency issues in the driving lesson scheduling system, specifically resolving mismatches between TypeScript interfaces and Mongoose schema definitions that are causing build failures.

## Glossary

- **ScheduleDrivingLesson**: TypeScript interface defining the structure of driving lesson objects
- **InstructorSchema**: Mongoose schema definition for instructor documents in MongoDB
- **Driving_Lesson_API**: API endpoints that handle driving lesson operations (create, update, reject, etc.)
- **Type_Consistency**: Alignment between TypeScript interfaces and Mongoose schema field definitions

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript interfaces to match Mongoose schema definitions, so that the application builds without type errors

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built, THE Driving_Lesson_API SHALL compile without TypeScript errors related to paymentMethod property
2. THE ScheduleDrivingLesson interface SHALL have field optionality that matches the Mongoose schema definition
3. THE InstructorSchema SHALL define paymentMethod field optionality consistently with the TypeScript interface
4. WHEN paymentMethod is null or undefined, THE Driving_Lesson_API SHALL handle the property assignment without runtime errors
5. THE ScheduleDrivingLesson interface SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing driving lesson data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent type definitions across the codebase, so that I can work with driving lesson objects predictably

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE ScheduleDrivingLesson interface SHALL define all fields with the same optionality as the corresponding Mongoose schema
2. WHEN accessing ScheduleDrivingLesson properties, THE TypeScript compiler SHALL provide accurate type checking
3. THE Mongoose schema SHALL support optional paymentMethod values without validation errors
4. WHEN saving instructor documents with driving lessons, THE database operations SHALL succeed regardless of paymentMethod presence
5. THE type definitions SHALL be documented with clear field requirements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the driving lesson rejection functionality to work correctly, so that instructors can manage their schedules without system errors

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an instructor rejects a driving lesson, THE Driving_Lesson_API SHALL update the lesson status successfully
2. WHEN paymentMethod is provided as null, THE Driving_Lesson_API SHALL remove the paymentMethod property from the lesson
3. WHEN paymentMethod is provided with a value, THE Driving_Lesson_API SHALL set the paymentMethod property on the lesson
4. THE lesson rejection process SHALL maintain data integrity for all other lesson properties
5. WHEN the rejection is complete, THE system SHALL broadcast the appropriate notification
