  - Document special cases that should not be removed
  - _Requirements: 7.5, 8.4_


- [x] 5. Convert .tsx model files to .ts safely






  - [x] 5.1 Verify .tsx files contain no JSX syntax




    - Check each .tsx file for React/JSX elements
    - Confirm files only contain TypeScript model definitions

    - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 4.7_
  


  - [x] 5.3 Validate conversion success




    - Verify TypeScript compilation succeeds after changes
    - Test that all imports resolve correctly
    - Ensure no broken references remain
    - _Requirements: 4.5, 4.6_

- [x] 6. Standardize existing model structures










  - [x] 6.1 Update models to consistent interface pattern









    - Add TypeScript interfaces extending Document where missing
    - Ensure consistent naming conventions (PascalCase)
    - Standardize import statements across all models
    - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.4_
  
-

  - [x] 6.2 Standardize schema definitions and exports







    - Update schema field type definitions for consistency
    - Implement consistent export pattern using mongoose.models
    - Add createdAt/updatedAt timestamps where appropriate
    - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.5_
  
  - [x] 6.3 Add proper type references and constraints








    - Include Schema.Types.ObjectId references for relationships
    - Add required field markers and unique constraints
    - Ensure optional fields are properly typed
    - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 7. Generate missing models for MongoDB collections





  - Create model files for collections that lack TypeScript models
  - Use consistent template structure for all new models
  - Implement proper field types based on collection data analysis
  - Add appropriate indexes and constraints based on collection structure
  - _Requirements: 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 8. Remove unused models and corresponding APIs





  - [x] 8.1 Create removal report and get confirmation






    - Generate list of models marked for removal
    - Identify corresponding API routes that may also be unused
    - Create detailed report of files to be removed
    - _Requirements: 7.7_
  
  - [x] 8.2 Remove unused model files


    - Delete model files that are confirmed unused
    - Remove corresponding unused API route files
    - Clean up any related utility files
    - _Requirements: 7.2, 7.6_
  
  - [x] 8.3 Verify no broken references after removal


    - Scan codebase for any remaining references to removed models
    - Ensure no import errors or compilation issues
    - Test application functionality after cleanup
    - _Requirements: 6.4, 6.5_

- [x] 9. Final validation and testing




  - [x] 9.1 Comprehensive import validation


    - Verify all model imports resolve correctly across the codebase
    - Test TypeScript compilation of entire project
    - Ensure no broken import statements remain
    - _Requirements: 6.4, 6.5_
  
  - [-] 9.2 Model functionality testing





    - Test database operations with updated models
    - Verify CRUD operations work correctly
    - Ensure all existing API endpoints continue functioning
    - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.1_
  
  - [ ]* 9.3 Create comprehensive model documentation
