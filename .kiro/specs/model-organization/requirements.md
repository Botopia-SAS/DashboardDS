# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to organize and standardize all MongoDB models in the project by creating consistent TypeScript model files for each database collection. The system currently has multiple collections in MongoDB that need proper TypeScript models with interfaces, schemas, and consistent patterns.

## Glossary

- **Model**: A TypeScript file that defines the structure and schema for a MongoDB collection
- **Schema**: Mongoose schema definition that maps to MongoDB collection structure
- **Interface**: TypeScript interface that defines the type structure for the model
- **Collection**: MongoDB database collection that stores documents
- **Document**: Individual record in a MongoDB collection

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all MongoDB collections to have corresponding TypeScript model files, so that I can work with type-safe database operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the lib/models directory, THE System SHALL contain a TypeScript model file for each MongoDB collection
2. WHEN a model file is created, THE System SHALL follow a consistent naming convention using PascalCase
3. WHEN a model file is created, THE System SHALL include both TypeScript interface and Mongoose schema definitions
4. WHERE a collection exists in MongoDB, THE System SHALL have a corresponding .ts model file (not .tsx)
5. THE System SHALL ensure all model files use the same export pattern and structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent model structure across all files, so that the codebase is maintainable and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a model file, THE System SHALL include a TypeScript interface extending Document
2. WHEN defining a schema, THE System SHALL use consistent field type definitions
3. WHEN exporting the model, THE System SHALL use the mongoose.models pattern to prevent re-compilation errors
4. THE System SHALL include proper imports for mongoose, Schema, Document, and Model types
5. WHERE timestamps are needed, THE System SHALL include createdAt and updatedAt fields with Date.now default

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to extract model structures from existing MongoDB collections, so that I can create accurate TypeScript definitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a MongoDB collection, THE System SHALL identify all field types and structures
2. WHEN a collection has references to other collections, THE System SHALL include proper Schema.Types.ObjectId references
3. WHEN a field is required in the database, THE System SHALL mark it as required in the schema
4. THE System SHALL handle optional fields appropriately in both interface and schema
5. WHERE unique constraints exist, THE System SHALL include unique: true in the schema definition

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up inconsistent file extensions and ensure proper imports, so that all models use .ts and all imports remain functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the models directory, THE System SHALL identify files with .tsx extensions that contain only model definitions
2. WHEN converting a .tsx file to .ts, THE System SHALL search the entire codebase for imports referencing the old file
3. WHEN updating file extensions, THE System SHALL update all import statements to reference the new .ts extension
4. THE System SHALL ensure no JSX syntax exists in model files before conversion
5. THE System SHALL verify that all imports continue to work correctly after conversion
6. THE System SHALL maintain exact same exports and functionality after conversion
7. WHERE imports use the old .tsx extension, THE System SHALL update them to use .ts extension

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive model coverage for all collections, so that no database operations lack type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL create models for collections visible in MongoDB Compass
2. WHEN a new collection is identified, THE System SHALL generate a corresponding model file
3. THE System SHALL handle collections with complex nested structures appropriately
4. WHERE collection names use different casing, THE System SHALL normalize to consistent PascalCase for model names
5. THE System SHALL ensure all models are properly exported and importable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure import efficiency and safety, so that the model organization doesn't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating model files, THE System SHALL scan all TypeScript and JavaScript files for existing imports
2. THE System SHALL create a comprehensive list of all files that import each model
3. WHEN changing file extensions or model names, THE System SHALL update all corresponding import statements
4. THE System SHALL verify that all imports resolve correctly after changes
5. THE System SHALL ensure no broken imports remain in the codebase after reorganization
### R
equirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused models and APIs, so that the codebase is clean and only contains actively used code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the codebase, THE System SHALL identify models that are not imported or used anywhere
2. WHEN a model file is not referenced in any pages, components, or API routes, THE System SHALL mark it for removal
3. THE System SHALL scan all pages, components, API routes, and other TypeScript files for model usage
4. WHERE a model has no corresponding MongoDB collection, THE System SHALL mark it for removal
5. THE System SHALL preserve cron job related models even if they appear unused in regular application code
6. WHEN removing unused models, THE System SHALL also identify and remove corresponding unused API routes
7. THE System SHALL create a report of files to be removed before actual deletion

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that models correspond to actual collections, so that only relevant models exist in the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing models to MongoDB collections, THE System SHALL identify models without corresponding collections
2. THE System SHALL identify MongoDB collections without corresponding models
3. WHERE a model exists but no collection exists in MongoDB, THE System SHALL investigate if the model is still needed
4. THE System SHALL check if unused models are referenced in cron jobs, scheduled tasks, or background processes
5. THE System SHALL ensure that models like Collection.ts are removed if no "collections" collection exists in MongoDB
