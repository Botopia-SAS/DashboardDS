## Issues Found

### ⚠️ Application Button Not Working
**Problem**: The test button in the application (`handleTestCertificates`) was not generating PDFs correctly.

**Root Cause**: The `getVariables` function was extracting `court` and `county` from `otherFields` after destructuring, but these fields were being passed directly in the Student object.

**Fix Applied**: Modified `components/ticket/hooks/pdf-helpers/utils.ts` to extract `court` and `county` directly in the destructuring statement:
```typescript
const {
  // ... other fields
  court, // Extract court directly
  county, // Extract county directly
  ...otherFields
} = user;
```

- Verified: Y-coordinates correctly calculated using PDF coordinate system (Y=0 at bottom)

### Requirement 1.3 ✅
**WHEN the template specifies 3 certificates per page, THE Certificate Generator SHALL ensure text elements for certificate 1 appear in the top slot (Y: 528-792pt), certificate 2 in the middle slot (Y: 264-528pt), and certificate 3 in the bottom slot (Y: 0-264pt)**
- Verified: All certificates positioned in correct slots with proper offsetY
